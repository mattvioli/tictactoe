# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic Tac Toe game, or noughts and crosses for people using proper english.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this game.

## Features

You can enter names for both players.
The game will keep track of the wins.
If you want to leave and come back later, your scores and names will stay.

To reset scores and names click 'Reset Game'

You can also adjust the size of the board.
I have added an EasyAI and a Medium AI and am working on a Minimax/hard AI.

## Planning
I started by creating all the features into issues, and focusing on them as single goals.

## Known Bugs

Occasionally, as the Easy AI is using a random number generator, it will look for ages looking for a free space.
To fix this, I will need to grab the possible moves, as I did with the Hard Ai and get it to randomly pick on of them.
